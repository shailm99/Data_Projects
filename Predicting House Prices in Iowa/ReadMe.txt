# My First Data Exploration: 

I thought this was a good starting point to try and apply the skills I have learned in python and data science. I have tried to use machine learning models and even investigated how I could fine-tune these models to make them better. This was my first exploration into data science and it was done in a programming langauge I am very unfamiliar with. I took this as a learning experience in order to grow as a data scientist.

Since this was my first project I leaned on few other resources to guide me through the structure of a data science project as well as help me out when my code was not working. I have include these references below:
