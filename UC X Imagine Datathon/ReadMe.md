# UC X Imagine Scholar Datathon 2020

Over the past weekend, I was able to take part in the UC X Imagine Scholar Datathon, and win the best novice project. This event was allowed to pursue my passion for data alongside other students from all the UC campuses, and do so for a great cause. 
Imagine Scholar, a nonprofit organization that runs an after-school mentorship program in rural South Africa, works with low-income students to provide academic enrichment and support. Over the weekend, we were all challenged to analyze and/or visualize data about energy and load shedding in South Africa in a insightful and creative way. 
I decided to apply unsuperivised machine learning and explore whether South Africaâ€™s economic growth and environmental sustainability is in fact linked to its electricity production. I was chosen as the best novice project for this event. More importantly, I was able to gain invaluable experience into cleaning and preprocessing real-world datasets to derive impactful insights! I have linked my written report, which details my methodology, findings and conclusion. Overall, it was a great experience, and I am looking forward to taking part in more datathons in the future!
