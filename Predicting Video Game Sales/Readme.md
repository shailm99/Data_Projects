# A Data-Dive into the Video Game Industry

With the recent boom in the total production, it is indeed important for video game producers to understand the factors that determine an individual game's total sales. With this invaluable insight, producers will be able to alter their production to maximise their total revenues. By putting my newly-acquried python skills to the test, I have attempted to answer these riveting questions and more by analysing over 16,000 video game sales data.

I first start by cleaning and understanding the structure of our dataframe by looking at the distribution and skewness of each variable. After this, I move onto performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on our dataset in order to uncover key trends within the industry. Following the EDA, I move on to some feature engineering using the dataset in order to transform existing features into more informative ones that will help in the creation of a better model. Finally, I go through the extensive process of model buliding, fine tuning and optimizing to create an overall final model. This is done tested on a portion of our data set to obtain key performance metrics for our final model. To top this off, I finish by exploring the importance of each feature in our model using permutation importance. 

Please feel free to give me your feedback on how I can improve my code for future as I am relatively new to coding and eager to learn how I can improve.
