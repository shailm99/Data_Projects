# Indian Premier League (IPL) Cluster Analysis

As the upcoming season of the IPL draws closer, I was interested in studying the data from previous seasons to derive fascinating insights. In the notebook attached, I start my analysis by looking exploring individual player trends such as bowling and batsmen combinations. After this, I move on to cleaning the entire delivery level dataset to engineer key features for each aspect of the game such as boundaries hit, death overs bowled, number of run outs, etc. This is then followed by the application of unsupervised machine learning by applying the KMeans Algorithm to my cleaned player level dataset. Following this, I explored the different clusters to derive meaningful and actionable insights about the tactics that can be used in the upcoming IPL season. 

To read more about my methodology, interpretations and the key insights derived please feel free to check out my [blog post](https://mirpurishail.wixsite.com/portfolio/post/ipl-2020-what-do-the-numbers-say) on this project!
